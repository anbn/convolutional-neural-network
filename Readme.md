# Next Steps

* Dropout layer
* implement Stride

## Nice to have

* loading and saving of networks
* DBN
  * RBM pretraining import weights

## Optional

* Levenberg-Marquardt

### Features
* weight initialization
  * *Weights are sampled randomly from a uniform distribution in the range [-1/fan-in, 1/fan-in], where fan-in is the number of inputs to a hidden unit*
